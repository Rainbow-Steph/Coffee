# Compilation Fix Verification Report

## ? **ALL COMPILATION ERRORS FIXED!**

### Issue Found:
The `ClickableObject.cs` file was missing the entire single-item holding system that was documented in the README and other documentation files.

### Changes Made to `ClickableObject.cs`:

#### 1. **Added Static Tracking System** (Lines 11-37)
```csharp
// Static variables to track currently held item across all instances
private static ClickableObject currentlyHeldObject = null;

public static string HeldItemName { get; }
public static bool IsAnyItemHeld { get; }
public static ClickableObject GetHeldObject()
```

#### 2. **Added Pickup Prevention Logic** (In `ToggleFloat()`)
- Checks if another item is already being held
- Blocks pickup attempt with debug message
- Prevents multiple items from being held simultaneously

#### 3. **Added Registration Logic** (In `StartFloating()`)
- Registers object as `currentlyHeldObject` when picked up
- Logs the currently held item name in debug mode

#### 4. **Added Unregistration Logic** (In `StopFloating()`)
- Unregisters object when returned to position
- Sets `currentlyHeldObject` to null

#### 5. **Added Cleanup Logic** (In `OnDestroy()`)
- Cleans up held object reference if destroyed while held
- Prevents null reference exceptions
