## What This Means

### Setup Process:
**Before:** Three automated setup methods (Editor script, Runtime component, Manual)
**Now:** Manual setup only

### How to Set Up HeldItemDisplay (Manual Process):

1. **Create UI Text:**
   - Right-click Canvas ? UI ? Text (or Text - TextMeshPro)

2. **Add Component:**
   - Select the Text object
   - Add Component ? HeldItemDisplay

3. **Configure:**
   - Component auto-detects Text/TMP
- Customize prefix and empty text
- Position with RectTransform

## Benefits of Manual Setup

? **More Control** - Full customization of UI positioning and styling
? **Simpler** - No editor scripts or dependencies
? **Transparent** - Clear understanding of what's being created
? **Flexible** - Easy to modify or extend

## Migration Notes

If you had previously used the editor scripts:
- Your existing HeldItemDisplay components will continue to work
- No changes needed to existing setups
- Future setups require manual creation (see README.md)

---

## Summary

The automatic setup scripts have been removed to simplify the project. The HeldItemDisplay component still works exactly the same way, but now requires manual setup in the Unity Editor.

**Updated Documentation:** See README.md for manual setup instructions.
